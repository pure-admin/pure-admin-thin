## Introduce

The simplified version is based on the shelf extracted from [vue-pure-admin](https://github.com/pure-admin/vue-pure-admin), which contains main functions and is more suitable for actual project development. The packaged size is introduced globally [element-plus](https://element-plus.org) is still below `2.3MB`, and the full version of the code will be permanently synchronized. After enabling `brotli` compression and `cdn` to replace the local library mode, the package size is less than `350kb`
