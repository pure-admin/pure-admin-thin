**English** | [中文](./README.md)

## introduce

The Lite version is based on the shelf extracted from [vue-pure-admin](https://github.com/xiaoxian521/vue-pure-admin), including the main functions, which is more suitable for actual project development, and the packaged size is lower than ` 3MB`, and will permanently sync the full version of the code. After enabling `brotli` compression and `cdn` to replace the native library mode, the package size is less than `500kb`
